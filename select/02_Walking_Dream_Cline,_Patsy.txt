A walkin' dream
I dreamed about you
A walkin' dream
Can't do without you

Lovely dream
Just can't forget you
'Cause your so dreamy, peach n' creamy
Walkin' dream

Now keep on a walkin'
Keep on a talkin'
And I'll do my best to make the rest
Of this lovely dream come true

A walkin' dream
I want you near me
Walkin' dream
Can't you hear me?

Lovely dream
Won't you love me?
'Cause your so lovey, turtle dovey
A walkin' dream

A walkin' dream
My heart is yearnin'
Walkin' dream
My lips are burnin'

Lovely dream
Of love I'm learnin'
'Cause your surprisin', tantilizin'
Walkin' dream

Now keep on a walkin'
Keep on a talkin'
And I'll do my best to make the rest
Of this lovely dream come true

A walkin' dream
I want you near me
A walkin' dream
Can't you hear me?

Lovely dream
Won't you love me?
'Cause your so lovey, turtle dovey
Walkin' dream
'Cause your so lovey, turtle dovey
Walkin' dream
